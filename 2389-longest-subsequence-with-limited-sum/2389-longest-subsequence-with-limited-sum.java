        and the problem needs optimal solution like maximum so we can clearly say that its a problem of
        DP
        
        and also we can figure out its quite similar to Knapsack problem or we can say its a variation of it.
        so to deal with this solution which is similar to knapsack where i need max length of nums which we
        will pick as subsequence.

        //for this we need to pick smaller elements first to reach with the solution
